# HarmonyDagger Project: Executive Summary

## Overview

HarmonyDagger is an implementation of the HarmonyCloak technique for making music unlearnable to generative AI while remaining perceptually unchanged for human listeners. This document summarizes our planned feature roadmap to extend the project's current capabilities toward a more complete implementation of the research paper's concepts.

## Strategic Goals

1. **Enhance Protection Effectiveness**: Improve psychoacoustic masking through more advanced algorithms
2. **Maintain Audio Quality**: Ensure protected audio remains high-quality for human listeners
3. **Improve Usability**: Make the tool accessible to musicians without technical expertise
4. **Ensure Real-World Viability**: Guarantee protection survives common audio processing workflows
5. **Enable Broader Adoption**: Package features for use in common audio editing environments

## Key Principles

All planned features are designed to:
- **Run on Consumer Hardware**: No GPU-intensive operations required
- **Preserve Audio Quality**: Minimal perceptual impact on the original audio
- **Offer Flexible Configuration**: Adjustable protection levels for different use cases
- **Support Various Music Genres**: Optimized settings for different musical content

## Feature Roadmap Summary

### Core Technology Enhancements
- **Windowed Frequency Alignment**: Dynamic noise mapping with short time frames (10ms)
- **Multi-Track Support**: Independent channel processing for better stereo/multichannel support
- **Adaptive Temporal Masking**: Leverage pre/post-masking effects around transients

### Quality Assurance
- **Perceptual Quality Metrics**: Objective scoring of audio quality before/after protection
- **MP3 Compression Resilience**: Testing to ensure protection survives common distribution formats

### User Experience
- **Genre-Aware Presets**: Optimized settings for different music genres
- **Enhanced Batch Processing**: Process entire music libraries with detailed reports
- **Spectrogram Visualization**: Visual tools to understand and fine-tune protection

### Distribution Channel
- **Audacity Plugin Integration**: Packaging the technology for use in popular audio software

## Implementation Strategy

The roadmap is designed for incremental development with each feature building on previous work:

1. Start with core algorithm improvements (frequency alignment, temporal masking)
2. Add quality metrics to validate effectiveness
3. Enhance file handling and visualization capabilities
4. Implement usability features like presets and batch processing
5. Package for broader distribution via Audacity plugin

## Resource Requirements

The project will require:
- Python development expertise in audio processing
- Testing across various music genres and styles
- User feedback from musicians for preset optimization
- Limited design work for visualization components

## Timeline

Please refer to the detailed ROADMAP.md file and ROADMAP_VISUALIZATION.md for implementation sequencing and dependencies.

## Project Artifacts

This project includes three key documentation files:
- **EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md**: This high-level overview (current document)
- **ROADMAP.md**: Detailed technical specifications for each feature branch
- **ROADMAP_VISUALIZATION.md**: Visual representation of feature dependencies and implementation sequence

## Conclusion

The HarmonyDagger roadmap provides a clear path to extend the current implementation toward a more complete realization of the HarmonyCloak research. By focusing on consumer-grade implementations that don't require specialized hardware, we aim to make this technology accessible to a wide range of musicians who want to protect their work from unauthorized AI training.
